# Assassin-Game

This is a game of Assassins where everyone is trying to murder everyone. This game maintains a history of who is currently alive and whom they are stalking. Similarly, it keeps a record of who was assassinated and by who.

## What I Worked On
I scripted the AssassinNode.java and AssassinManager.java file which maintains the game's ability to tracka and record as the player is playing.
